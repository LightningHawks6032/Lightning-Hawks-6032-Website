  <h3>What is outreach to us?</h3>
  <p>Our team Lightning Hawks has four different parts of outreach that we consider very important. </p>
  <ul>
    <li> We believe that our community is one of the important parts of our team identity and as such we make it our mission to give back to our community through our four core initiatives. We support <span style="color: red">our community</span> by participating in local events run by town officials and by running our own community events around town. We also continue to support local businesses by organizing local fundraisers at their establishments and bringing in customers for them. </li>
    <br>
    <li> Our second initiative is to preserve <span style="color: red">the environment</span>. This initiative is very crucial to our team, to our community, and to our state as New England is known for its breathtaking forests and scenery. </li>
    <br>
    <li> Our third initiative is to give back to <span style="color: red">our school</span>, Natick High School, which spent large sums of money to provide us the robotics lab that we use every year and has supplied us with a landmark STEM curriculum that enhances our abilities. </li>
    <br>
    <li> Our final initiative is to support the <span style="color: red">FIRST community</span> which has given us a huge opportunity to explore the fields of robotics and STEM in a fun and competitive environment. </li>
  </ul>

    <h2>April STEM Camp</h2>
    <p>During the 2017-2018 school year, RoboNatick held another April Stem camp. The camp which took place over april break was designed to allow students (campers) to conduct experiments and engineer solutions in the stem field. The camp took place over four days with each day focusing on a different topic. Tuesday was focused on chemistry and biology, Wednesday was for engineering, Thursday for computer science and Friday for physics.</p>

    <h2>Natick Days</h2>
    <p> Natick Days is an annual festival that celebrates the Natick community by providing an opportunity for non-profit groups to increase visibility for the work they do. RoboNatick participated in this event again and we set up a stand advertising and showing off our work. Thousands of people attended this event and we were able to show off our robot to the community. The majority of our time was spent allowing people to drive our robot and explaining about First and robonatick. We were also able to sell donuts for more fundraising. </p>

    <h2>Senior Center Technology Workshop</h2>
    <p> On September 21, 2022, our team visited the Natick Senior Center to teach seniors about technology, specifically computers. We had three different groups – surfing the internet, email functions, and miscellaneous – to help them learn multiple skills. In addition, we had a member to help each senior who attended, allowing us to help them with their individual issues. Overall, we were able to help them with things they had trouble doing and understanding, and the event was definitely a success!

    <h2>Leaf Raking Seniors’ Yards</h2>
    <p> Throughout the month of November, we contacted seniors from a list given to us by the Natick Council on Aging. We gathered robotics team members and traveled to the seniors’ houses on Saturdays and Sundays to rake and bag all their leaves. Sometimes, they had questions about technology for us. For example, we aided one woman with her sleep apnea machine. The seniors were very friendly and some gave us cookies and drinks. We had numerous enlightening conversations with the homeowners who showed us an enormous amount of kindness and gratitude. They shared stories about everything from college to landscaping, and taught us valuable lessons about life. We also learned how powerful playing an active role in the community can be and we hope to do more service projects like this in the future.

    <h2>Lunch Robot Expo</h2>
    <p> On November 9, 2022, our team hosted a robot expo in front of our school cafeteria. We set up our field and brought our outreach robot. To our dismay, we had a lot of issues in the beginning, the main one being our robot and controller not connecting. This wasted a lot of time and students during first and second lunches were unable to drive our robot. Luckily, we got the robot moving by the end of the second lunch, and it was very successful for the next two lunches. We attracted quite a crowd, and many students were very enthusiastic about driving our robot, especially because of the maze we created on the field. We also gave everyone who drove the robot our team sticker!

    <h2>Annual Tweens Robotics Workshop</h2>
    <p> On November 16, 2022, our team hosted our annual Tween Robotics Workshop in partnership with our local library, Morse Institute Library. At this event, we had two stations: one where the tweens could drive our robot around a maze we created on the field, and one where they watched the PowerPlay challenge video. After both groups had a chance at both stations, we all regrouped to brainstorm and share robot design ideas based on the video. Overall, the event ran smoothly, and all the kids were very interested in our team and what we do, and enthusiastic about sharing their ideas.

  <div class="outreachEvent"> <img src="images/boston dynamics.png" alt="Our team at Boston Dynamics with Spot the robodog">
    <h2>Boston Dynamics Tour</h2>
    <p> On December 6th, 2022, our team visited the Boston Dynamics headquarters to tour. We received an introduction of their history, starting from their biped non-independent robots in the 1990s at MIT. Then, we got to see Boston Dynamics’ facilities, some of which include their Spot testing facilities, shipping bots, programming centers, motor test sites, and more. There, they used CAD to produce far more expensive and complicated parts, such as Atlas’ titanium soles. Along the way, we were approached by the wandering Spots, and were even given the opportunity to drive them! We controlled it to open doors, twist levers, walk on rocks, pick up and drop items, and walk up and down the stairs. This event was an incredible opportunity for our team to see a far more advanced engineering process and get hands-on experience with larger scale robots.

    <h2>Boston Dynamics Tour</h2>
    <p> On January 12, 2023, a few members on our team went to two preschool classes to host a fun robotics workshop. We introduced high school and our team to the kids, and we showed them our current competition robot, which they were very interested in, especially the long slides which they were eager to compare their own heights with! Then, we had a robot color session, and we had a competition to see who has the most creative name for the robot they colored. Since the kids had a lot of energy, we also played Freeze Dance with them, playing fun robot rhymes. We ended the session with a read aloud of the picture book, "Robots, Robots everywhere." Overall, it was incredibly fun for both us and the kids, and we loved interacting with them!
